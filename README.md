# Computer Networks I â€“ Practical Exercises

This repository contains a collection of practical exercises and simulations related to basic computer networking concepts.

Each folder corresponds to a specific topic or activity covered during the course, such as:

- Network configuration (static and dynamic IPs)
- Routing protocols (RIP, OSPF, static routing)
- DHCP, DNS, and NAT configurations
- Network addressing and subnetting
- Packet analysis and simulation (e.g., Packet Tracer)

Each exercise includes a brief description, configuration steps or code, and expected outcomes.

> This project is part of my academic journey in the Computer Networks I course at FENG-UEM.
